$ docker run -it --rm hello-world-java
```

#####Test application
first you need to find ContainerId of the running Docker image
```
$ docker ps
```
you can find ContainerId in a row where IMAGE column contains 'hello-world-java' phrase

then you need to find IP address of the running Docker image
```
$ docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' [ContainerId]
